# Releasing Foundry VTT modules on Github

So you're developing an amazing new Foundry VTT module, but every time you want to release your next version you forget to update all the files in the zip and upload it. Or maybe you feel it's wrong to put the zip file inside the git repository.

Well, you've come to the right address. Let's create a Github workflow to automatically release your latest versions!

## Step 1: Establishing a file structure
Every foundry module consists of at least a manifest (`module.json`) and a javascript file. In this example, I'll also assume you might want to include translations and templates. However, if you don't have them, just ignore them.

Let's assume our module is called `my-module`. Our file structure will look something like this:

```
/my-module/
    - lang/
        - en.json
        - fr.json
    - module.json
    - my-module.js
    - templates/
        - my-template.html
```
*The file structure of our module 'my-module'.*

To get started with Github actions, we need to add another directory first. In the root of your repository add the following folders and file: `.github/workflows/main.yml`. *The `.` (period) in front of "github" is important!*

```
/my-module/
    - .github/
        - workflows/
            - main.yml
    - lang/
    - module.json
    - my-module.js
    - templates/
```

## Step 2: Setting up your first workflow

Inside `.github/workflows/main.yml` add the following text:
```yml
name: my-module CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Create Release
      id: create_latest_release
      uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
      with:
        allowUpdates: true
        name: Latest
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        artifacts: './module.json'
        tag: latest
```

If you push these changes to Github, you should see the first release being created after a few minutes. You can check the progress at `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/actions`.

When you take a look at the release, you will see that we have successfully uploaded `module.json` and you can use the link to this *asset* as the manifest url in your future `module.json` and in the Foundry administration panel.

## Step 3: Creating and adding the zip file
However, one file is still missing: the `my-module.zip`! To create this file we need to add another file to `.github/workflows/` named `create-zip.sh`. Inside this file, you will need the following contents:

```bash
zip -r ./my-module.zip module.json my-module.js lang/ templates/
```

> ! Important. In order to make it executable in the workflow. Also execute the following command on your command line: `git update-index --add --chmod=+x .github/workflows/create-zip.sh`.

And to your `.github/workflows/main.yml` you need to add the following changes:

```yml
name: my-module CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - run: ./.github/workflows/create-zip.sh        # Call the script to create the zip-file
    - name: Create Release
      id: create_release
      uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
      with:
        allowUpdates: true
        name: Latest
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        artifacts: './module.json,./my-module.zip' # Add the created zip-file to the release
        tag: latest
```

Pushing those changes should update the existing release with `my-module.zip` in the list of assets.

> NB: The attached source code on the release will **not** be updated and the tag will **not** be moved in your repository.
> However, when you download attached `module.json`, you will see it is indeed updated. ðŸ˜€

## Bonus: Creating a separate release for every version
It is often useful to provide older versions too, in case users want to revert or if you need it for testing purposes.

### Extract the version
Inside `.github/workflows/` create a new file named `get-version.js` with the following content:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
console.log(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('module.json', 'utf8')).version);
```

Inside your `.github/workflows/main.yml` add the following change:

```yml
name: my-module CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - run: ./.github/workflows/create-zip.sh
    - name: Get Version                                   # Run the script that returns the version from `module.json`
      shell: bash
      id: get-version
      run: echo "::set-output name=version::$(node ./.github/workflows/get-version.js)"
    - name: Create Release                                # Create an additional release for this version
      id: create_versioned_release
      uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
      with:
        allowUpdates: true
        name: Release ${{ steps.get-version.outputs.version }} # Use the version in the name
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        artifacts: './module.json,./my-module.zip'
        tag: ${{ steps.get-version.outputs.version }} # Use the version as the tag
    - name: Create Release
      id: create_versioned_release
      uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
      if: endsWith(github.ref, 'master') # Only update the latest release when pushing to the master branch
      with:
        allowUpdates: true
        name: Latest
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        artifacts: './module.json,./my-module.zip'
        tag: latest
```

This will create (or update) two releases: the *Latest* release and a separate release for the version specified in `module.json`.
As an addition, we added `if: endsWith(github.ref, 'master')` to the *Latest* release, so that it only updates when you push new code to the master branch.
So if you do all your experimental development on a separate branch, the *Latest* release stays stable.
